<p class="meta">07 Oct 2018 - London</p>

I have finally started my studies at King's College London. And not to much surprise, my choices and experience so far has been completely tangential to what I anticipated. I have chosen modules I never thought I would, signing up for programs that did not fall into my radar during my pre-country research and having my own skepticisms about the "cold-ness" of the city in general. 

One of the interesting programs I have enrolled in is the [King's Cultural Experience Award](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/cultural/-/projects/kings-cultural-experience-award.aspx). As fancy as the word "Award" sounds, it is actually 'a ten week co-curricular course that allows you to explore and map your cultural London in a fun, sociable and supported way.' It is perfect for me on so many levels: I get to see a lot of London and that too during reasonable hours, with a group of people sharing my interest! As a course requirement, I am expected to turn in at least 5 blog posts about the tours we take and I have used this as an opportunity to finally finish my Github website using Jekyll.

Today was the first session and they decided to give us a taste of how our upcoming sessions will be. We started from the Inigo rooms in Somerset House: Somerset House is a magnificent building right next to my Strand "campus". (Oh, how I miss actual campuses) I cannot wait to see the ice skating rink that, they say, will be setup during the winter at Somerset. We went to the King's Chapel, a beautiful unconventional English chapel at King's. Coming from India, I did not know that chapels were not supposed to be as decorated and bright. Also, I learnt what an "organ" is for the first time. So many episodes of [Mozart in the Jungle](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3502172/) and I still learn about new musical instruments. The major appeal of the chapel is definitely the shining interior and almost an ironical serenity that surrounds the place. But we were also given insight into how they expanded the chapel in the second floor out of the building (quite literally) and supported it with beams that were raised from the ground. It was amazing to see those unassuming beams, protruding in the alley next door, were holding together one of the features KCL was historically proud of. Which is not that surprising if you know more about the alley next door, that is the Strand Lane. The Strand Lane is also home to Roman Bath, which is a small bathing/irrigation system setup in [1612](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Baths,_Strand_Lane) for usage at the Somerset House that once was a palace. We got a special access to this hidden historical site and it reminded me of the vintage bath tub at my grandparent's place. Was it a colonial thing? I am not too sure.

We also visited Makerversity who inhabit a different wing of the Somerset House. Makerversity is a co-working space + Maker's garage and has a wing in Amsterdam as well. It was essentially the [Kyoto Maker's Garage](https://www.kyotomakersgarage.com/) I visited last month, but only 100x bigger and with so much more resources. We got a tour of the place, demo of some projects they're working on and the facilities they have. One of the interesting things is that our instructor kept refering to the Engineer/Tour Guide of Makerversity as an *artist*. In a world where very often arts and sciences are considered mutually exclusive, this was a fundamentally refreshing outlook. 

The tour ended at Bush House which is a building that recently became a part of KCL from its previous tenants, the BBC. As much as it was fascinating to imbibe the fact that I was literally in the middle of past, present and future, it was also inspiring how educational institutes have designed programmes like these to help raise cultural awareness. And that is something I definitely am taking with me when I go back to India.

On my way back home, there was a flautist and a guitarist on the tube who inspired a couple to break into a dance, right there, in the tube during transit! Such pleasure only reinstated the thought that was going through my head during the entire session: in a city like London, sometimes you go looking for cultural inspiration, sometimes it just finds you.
