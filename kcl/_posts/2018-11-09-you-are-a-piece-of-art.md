Disclaimer: No, I am not trying to objectify anyone.

It's been a few sessions of the Cultural award since I felt that inexplicable need to write a post that overtakes me when I am 
truly inspired. To be fair, our visit to the [Southbank Centre](https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/) was rather brilliant and I 
owe the absence of a post about it solely to my laziness (Pink Floyd got banned from the Purcell room at the Southbank Centre 
because they used bubble machines during their concert that ruined the leather chairs at the hall. Who would not want to write 
about that?) But the session on 6th November 2018 with the [Rambert Company](http://www.rambert.org.uk/) was one on which I 
would not forgive myself if I did not write.

It was the first session after what was a rather bipolar reading week. The team gathered in front of the Rambert Company
in [Lambeth](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rambert/@51.5061232,-0.1156433,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48760e6cbbcf9b61:0x847960275f647346!8m2!3d51.5061232!4d-0.1134546)
to finish the mid-term review and pool in for the 'Cultural Lucky Dip'. We then entered a rather modern building that
contributes to the contrast with the Victorian-styled ones inhabiting the other bank of river Thames. Everyone was dressed 
appropriately but that was not enough to prepare us for what the day held.

Rambert is the oldest dance company in the UK having delivered their first performance in 1926. Named after the Polish 
founder/ballerina Dame Marie Rambert, the company has evolved over time to both perform and teach Ballet and Contemporary 
dance. The building gave us some green-room insights into the lives of people who dedicate their lives to dance. We got a guided 
tour of the practice rooms and the costume room, with the latter resembling a library in the way it held the costumes organised 
and labelled and a huge freezer with walls so thick that no one would hear you if you were trapped inside. In fact, the 
entire building was temperature controlled in a way suitable for the dancers to avoid injuries. Anyone who saw those costumes 
would not have any extreme reaction: they were rather ordinary looking, at least for a nationally renowned dance company. But 
this observation was only waiting to be broken by the end of the day.

We then met Ms.Delene Gordon, our instructor at Rambert. Yes, we were going to have an hour and a half of Contemporary dance 
training session (One of the many reasons why I love this programme)! Ms.Gordon was obviously a brilliant dancer but she was also
super funny, patient, motivating and had a great taste in music which made the session comfortable for dance novices like me. She
is stated as an "Animateur" on Rambert's [website](http://www.rambert.org.uk/about-us/people/animateurs/), a word with French 
origin that means "A person who enlivens or encourages something, especially a promoter of artistic projects." Even though the 
word is French, the role was defined through the artistic activities in the 1980s UK which gave it a place in the English language.

Ms.Gordon is a professional trainer. She teaches people of all age groups, currently the youngest being 3 and the oldest being 
99! We covered some stretches and some dance moves involving lunges, plie, demi-plie, etc. But what caught my attention the most 
was something called a 'phrase' - which is described by a [website](https://www.contemporary-dance.org/dance-terms.html)
as "a short choreographic fragment that has an intention and feeling of a beginning and an end." It suddenly hit me how dance was
a language in itself with its own syntax and semantics like "phrases". This thought sinks in further when you actually dance. I
have watched a lot of dance performances in my life both in person and on TV. I have also been a part of a few performances (unsuccessfully, on the most part) 
But when Ms.Gordon said, "Do not think, just dance. Dance brings out a part of you which the brain is usually too slow to
process. Your body knows something which your brain has not comprehended yet", it gave me a whole new perspective - a perspective 
that was not new cognitively but was surreally expressive and liberating, physically. By the time our training ended, not only 
had I flexed some muscles that I probably never did in my entire life, (they ache even today) but also had become an instant fan 
of Ms.Gordon and the art she brought to life.

We then set out to [Sadler's Wells Theatre](https://www.sadlerswells.com/) to see a performance by the Rambert Company titled 
["Two"](http://www.rambert.org.uk/mixed-bills/two/) after its sister company. This was my first time attending a live 
Contemporary dance performance and I was not too sure what to expect. But it is safe to say that the experience is not something 
I will forget anytime soon. The evening had 4 performances in its agenda, one by the original Rambert and 3 by its sibling. It
started with 'Grey Matter' choreographed by Guest Artistic Director Benoit Swan Pouffer. It was this performance that showed me
how seemingly simple outfits with a few shades of colour on what was otherwise a wholly white costume can form beautiful art on
stage when they come together. The costumes were designed by the British designers [Cottweiler](https://www.cottweiler.com/), I 
read later. Following the group performance was a duet titled 'E2 7SD' put together by the Spanish choreographer Rafael Bonachela. 
<i> An interesting tid-bit: he auditioned successfully for Rambert when he was 20 years old. </i>

I did not think the performances could get any more intense but they did with the following pieces: 'Ghost dance' by the 
acclaimed choreographer Christopher Bruce was a "tribute to the victims of political oppression in South America", says Rambert's 
website. It takes visual inspiration from the characteristics of [Dia del los muertos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Dead) 
and is laden with earworm Latin American music. It is "one of the most celebrated contemporary dance pieces of its generation" 
says the website and I am not surprised. The show ended with "Killer Pig" choreographed by Sharon Eyal (Finally a female
choreographer!) The piece is long and the perfect word to describe it is 'brazen' as appropriately reviewed by [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/nov/07/rambert-two-review-sadlers-wells-london-sharon-eyal-killer-pig-benoit-swan-pouffer).
Everything about the performance, including the costume, the lighting and the music, had such an unwavering intensity to it that I did 
not realise it ran for 20 minutes more than the expected time of completion!

I have never had a day more dynamic than this one was, as far as I can remember. It made me appreciate the art of dance so much 
more than as a set routine that people practice till it becomes muscle memory. After all the Cultural award sessions where we dissected 
the process of creating art, this was a session where we became one.
