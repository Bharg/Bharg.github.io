<p class="meta">20 Jan 2019 - London</p>

There is something nostalgic about our first experiences. All the more so when that first experience leads to a certain addiction. (Five seconds into this trailer of ‘Beautiful Boy’ and you will know what I mean)

The first of my cultural visits in London was to the much-publicized [Science Gallery](https://london.sciencegallery.com/) opened last year in the Guy’s campus of King’s College London. Even though this visit happened in late September, before the Cultural award programme for the year had begun, having been a part of the programme has now made me reflect upon my experience and takeaways. 

Science Gallery’s debut exhibition was titled [‘Hooked: When want becomes need’](https://london.sciencegallery.com/seasons/hooked). It explored the evolution and the modern redefinition of the sources and impact of addiction and recovery. It had brought together researchers (mostly from King’s) and artists who delve into the different facets of addiction on a personal as well as societal level. With an overarching theme of how modern-day addiction to mobile phones and consumerism are not dissimilar to addiction to drugs and alcohol (one exhibit on mobile battery recharge was called 'Sisyphus'), the exhibition had many installations that were categorized as <ul>
	<li> Natural born thrillers </li>
	<li> Speed of light, denoting the pace of the world online </li>
	<li> Free will, questioning upon whom the addiction should be attributed to </li> 
	<li> Safe from Harm, that delves into recovery. </li>
</ul>

Curated by [Ms.Hannah Redler Hawes](https://twitter.com/hannah_redler), the gallery had many curious works, but their messages were sometimes not evident at first glance and thus took me by surprise. For example, what appeared to be a fancy curtain to the exhibit ‘Divorce Index’ by [Natasha Caruana](http://natashacaruana.com/), was actually made up of pawned, discarded wedding rings, acting as a powerful prelude to how addictions have broken families in the UK. The curtain was titled ‘Curtain of broken dreams’.

As unsettling as the whole exhibition was, the piece that made the most impact on me was the 16 mm video installation titled ‘The Workshop’. Directed by Mr.Dryden Goodwin, the video showcases young offenders at Oakhill Secure Training Centre describe and express their addiction experience, as inspired by Mr.Gee’s spoken word poetry and Mr.Angus Scott-Miller’s theatrical performances. Laden with Goodwin’s own visual essay of sketches and photographs, along with Professor Kim Wolff’s insights into drug use, the video translates underlying complex human emotions into a heart-warming, palatable ensemble.

Coming from India, Science Gallery caught my attention not only because its London branch is a part of my university but also because they are starting out a new chapter in [Bengaluru, India](https://bengaluru.sciencegallery.com/) along with its other chapters across the world. With the mission to bring together arts and science, Science Gallery is now embarking upon its exhibition for 2020 titled ‘Gender’ as well as other initiatives such as [‘Makeshop’](https://london.sciencegallery.com/events/makeshop-february-half-term-2019), a workshop for children to create art related robots. In a city like London with rich history of arts and its urgency to become a technology centre, Science Gallery is catering to the need of the hour, in our own backyard.
