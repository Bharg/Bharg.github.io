Have you ever been to a place that made you smile, for more than 2 hours straight? That is what happens when a Peanuts fan goes to an exhibition about Charlie Brown. The comic strip that I discovered and have adored over the last few years came to life surreally at the [Good grief, Charlie Brown!](https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/good-grief-charlie-brown) exhibit of the Somerset House. Having stored it away as a treat for surviving term 1 exams, I finally savoured it yesterday.

[Peanuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanuts), the comic strip, was started in 1950 by the American artist [Charles M. Schulz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_M._Schulz) and ran for over 5 decades, with re-runs continuing till date.  Its main characters include Charlie Brown, siblings Lucy and Linus van Pelt, a canary called Woodstock and the famous beagle Snoopy, inspired by Schulz’s own childhood dog Sparky. Other recurring characters include Franklin, the first African American in the strip who was introduced shortly after Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination in 1968, the Little Red-Haired girl, based on Schulz’s love interest Donna Mae Johnson who turned his proposal down, Peppermint Patty and Sally Brown.

‘Good grief, Charlie Brown’ delves into the ideology behind each of these characters as much as it does into the artist’s life. As someone who grew up in a rural household in Minnesota, Schulz was brought up with commands to never draw attention to himself. This probably grew into one of his core traits, prompting him to not have his face but the characters of the comic strip on the Time magazine cover.

Peanuts, for a casual reader, is an adorable comic about a bunch of kids and their pet(s). But over the span of 50 years, it has delved into complex issues of the time such as the Vietnam war and the Civil Rights movement, deconstructed philosophical texts such as Franz Kafka’s Metamorphosis and Jean Paul Sartre’s Nausea, and still managed to maintain its fun and innocence through visual onomatopoeia such as “Bonk”, “Zoom” and the signature \*\*sigh\*\*.

The exhibition has treasures from the history of the comics including printing panels of some of the comics, the moving letter from a high school teacher that led to the creation of Franklin, a detailed account of Schulz’s time in the army, the first illustration of Sparky on Ripley’s Believe It or Not, an interview with the real-life Red-haired girl herself, photographs from the time when Snoopy became the Apollo 10’s mascot (Astrobeagle!) and when people voted for his presidency!  It also includes artistic rendition of Peanut’s influence on modern day artists, a Peanuts-themed movie room with beds, a real Lucy-styled Psychiatric help booth, stall to make your own Peanuts comics and of course, a wonderful merchandise shop for Peanuts fans.

I spent more than 2 hours and still could not go through the entire exhibition. I intend to go again before it closes on 3rd March 2019, something I cannot resist while it is right next door to KCL. Or more importantly, because it is a comic strip that continues to stand the test of time both in relevance and appeal.
