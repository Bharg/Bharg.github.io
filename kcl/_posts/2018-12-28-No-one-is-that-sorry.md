During the final recap session of the Cultural award programme held on 4th December 2018, we were given a table of two columns, to be filled with words describing “What cultural identity did you come in with? What will you be leaving with?” - a retrospective <i> Before-After </i> chart. Word pairs including Passive – Active, Passerby – Explorer, Audience – Participant, Individuals – Team etc. adorned the chart. And my contribution to the “Before” column was the discomforting word ‘Skeptic’, referring to the session on Activism.

The 7th session of the Cultural award was titled ‘Arts, Crafts and Activism: Your Cultural Manifesto’ and was different from the other sessions we had so far in many aspects. For starters, it did not involve us leaving the KCL campus. It was held at the Inigo Rooms of the Somerset House East Wing on 13th November 2018 by [Ms.Jenny Leonard](https://jennyleonardart.com/) who describes herself as “a community driven commission artist” on her blog. On a personal level, activism always seemed like a thing of movies and history for me: something I knew about theoretically, something that I did not consider to be a part of my life, something that I’d be okay with looking from afar. Activism was the last thing I ever associated with “Culture” and I was skeptical about the content of this session.

The session started with Ms.Leonard showing us examples of how art and activism had gone together in various movements: she showed us pictures of activist art on issues ranging from pollution to body shaming to effects of Black Friday. Being in the UK, obviously the famous street artist [Banksy’s](http://www.banksy.co.uk/) works had a place in her presentation along with other works displayed everywhere from museums to pavements to the internet (#MeToo campaign) to the seams of denim jeans, emphasizing that location can make all the difference.

This presentation parallelly discussed the pre-workshop sheet that we were asked to fill out. The sheet titled “Practical activism” had questions around what we considered activism, its role today and the media used for the famous acts of activism we knew about. The sheet had a certain middle-school charm to it which along with the presentation gave me a peek inside the mind of activists.

After an open discussion of the material Ms.Leonard had collated for our workshop, it was time for us to create our own piece of activist art. I, who entered this session thinking that this was going to the most impersonal session of the Cultural award, was asked to create something as an activist. I was not ready for this! After almost 20 minutes of contemplating about global issues I care about, I suddenly pivoted to one of the issues I cared about personally: as an individual, as a woman, as a person who has spent many evenings of mindless “networking”. And it felt right to want to give this thought a shape and form.

In my pre-workshop sheet, there was a question that asked “The role of activism today is…” and I had written, <i> “showcase that seemingly ordinary people can make a change”. </i> It was not until I made my piece of activist art that this statement sunk in. A statement, that I wrote, made the fullest sense to me only after I created this work. It was certainly not as impressive as many of the works of my colleagues in the programme. But it was personal in a way I did not anticipate. And I left the following feedback for the session: (Bottom-right)

After the session, I went upto Ms.Leonard asking her how she gave a certain pedagogical structure to an abstract social concept like activism. She started talking to me about how I can do it too, that I just needed to reach out to some educational institutions, understand how their system worked, that usually they are open for such discussions and overall, it is just a lot of fun. A professional whose [art sculptures have been auctioned for over 32000 GBP](https://www.facebook.com/jennyleonardart/posts/2088846424513599?__xts__[0]=68.ARArRj-PAO8rVgveOVJflB6X0Aa54-5PBk3W5ueVD1dsD1ckJLmhOYMnvByqPHE4Buyoa5W266HlCrgFN3KlOjh0eeVZ6Ckrm-X6JdJHqM5DrCwuRdjAEG0aZNA5AOJgL9ps5x9uTPuCjHg9gmL9AwWJ2pLZnZT-JGFjgSeZ364bL9xetGklT9j57XAjBrizna4WMi7Cr-099mnYBLV6_UoSo6R9uDyQyRkZnU3MswiJKdlDZ4qVMhFbH-dBKCbIfCj3EG1qXiZbC9X1ePpNn3CHkoaBc58woCA_mEM38KXnvYbVJfq-UQykdHV8Lk8HNCfq1ocIKG3czgXA0GmETjnb9g&__tn__=-R) was advocating how I could do it too! And there it was again: that feeling of how activism was not something alien and was not something reserved for the select few. It truly was something that belonged to everyone, making it a part of our culture.
