  I am Sivaranjani Subramanian. I worked as an Application Developer for the last 1.5 years. Right now, I'm experimenting a little with Open Source and trying my hands on some front-end web development and Python. This website is one of the experimentations.

  You can download my resume here. To get in touch, drop me a mail at ranjani4ever@gmail.com.
